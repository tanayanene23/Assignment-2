Problem Statement:

Create an interactive to-do list web application that allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks. The application should provide a simple and intuitive user interface for managing their tasks effectively.

Requirements:

1. Task List Display: Display an empty task list when the page loads. Each task should have a checkbox, task description, and an option to delete the task.

2. Add Task: Provide a text input field and an "Add" button. When the user enters a task description and clicks the "Add" button, the task should be added to the list.

3. Edit Task: Allow users to edit a task's description by clicking on it. Display an editable input field when a user clicks on a task's description. After editing, the user can press Enter or click outside the input field to save the changes.

4. Mark Task as Completed: Users should be able to mark a task as completed by clicking its checkbox. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from active tasks.

5. Delete Task: Provide a delete button (e.g., a small "x" icon) next to each task. Clicking the delete button should remove the task from the list.

6. Local Storage: Persist the task list in the browser's local storage, so that the tasks are retained even after the user closes the browser.

7. Clear All Tasks: Include a "Clear All" button that clears all tasks from the list. Provide a confirmation prompt before clearing all tasks.

8. Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Bonus Challenges:

1. Add due dates or priorities to tasks.

2. Implement task categories or labels.

3. Allow users to filter tasks by status (completed/active) or other attributes.

4. Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.

Guidelines:

Use HTML for the structure and layout of the web page.

Use JavaScript for adding interactivity and handling user actions.

CSS can be used for styling and making the application visually appealing.
